U.S. Map

Bar Chart

Trump does not like to travel outside the U.S.
….and this is how it shows

If he does go abroad, he likes to go where he is popular(??)

Trump has visited 17 foreign countries (map with date of visit, scrollytelling showing his popularity in the places of visits)
(Different map showing countries the former presidents visited by this time)

That is less than his predecessors
