  This line means, use default.hbs layout from src/html/layouts/

  Put some content into an .hbs file inside of /partials,

<!-- 
  If you want to use something exported from ai2html...
    1. Rename the exported .html file to .hbs
    2. Put the .hbs file inside of 'html/story'
    3. Move the exported images to the images folder
    4. Include the partial normally like below

  You can also put the actual HTML here if you really want to,
  although it's a little less organized looking
